## API Overview

Based on the standard Nest CLI generated API, with the following customizations and enhancements:

- **JWT Authentication**
- **Roles base Authorization**
- **MongoDB Migration System**: A NestJS based Mongo migrations system. Uses DB to track migration state. As such works well in cloud and container environment where local file-based state is not guaranteed across deployments
- **Logger Service**: Production grade Logger, leveraging Winston
- **Configuration Service**: Strongly typed production-grade configuration system. Centralizes configuration and leverages both .env and fast and flexible ts object literal based configuration
- **e2e Testing**: e2e testing of controllers and services, including exercising of authentication and authorization
